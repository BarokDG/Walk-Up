## Overview
This project is a css animated motion graphic I created for a school football tournamnet final using vanila html, css, and javascript. I didn't have to worry about responsiveness or about writing clean code because people only saw a video I screen recorded with OBS. I didn't know much about After effects then so I made this after learning how to animate with css during my semester break. 

I'm back after nearly 2 years because I'm adding a few navigation features to show to some people and looking at the code showed me how much I've progressed as a developer. There are a lot of lines of css and javascript that made me cringe.
